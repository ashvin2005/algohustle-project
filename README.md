# AlgoHustle Project

A modern coding practice platform that helps programmers track their progress, manage problem-solving goals, and visualize their skill improvement over time. This application provides an intuitive dashboard with performance analytics and problem distribution charts.

## Features

- Problem tracking and management
- Rating progress visualization
- Problem distribution charts
- Goal setting and tracking
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

This project is built with React and Vite, featuring:

- React for UI components
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualization

## Development Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

### Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
